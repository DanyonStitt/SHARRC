            Without diverse voices as part of the conversation, it is nearly impossible to 
            discover optimal solutions. The ability to imagine something new or come up with 
            a new solution wholly depends upon involving a variety of viewpoints.

            New Zealand is facing some serious health challenges caused by ageing populations, 
            sedentary lifestyles, and unhealthy habits like smoking, poor diet, and alcohol 
            and drug abuse. These factors can lead to a variety of health issues, including 
            heart disease, diabetes, obesity, cancer, and mental health problems like 
            depression and anxiety.
        </p>
        <p class="para">
            The cost of these health issues is staggering - over $100 million per condition 
            or risk factor every year! Our team is passionate about promoting healthy living 
            and helping people prevent and overcome these health concerns. We believe that 
            everyone should have access to the best health care and support, regardless of 
            their background.
        </p>

        <p class="para">
            To prevent and rehabilitate from these health conditions, promoting physical 
            activity is essential. Fortunately, the NZ Ministry of Health has several 
            initiatives in place to promote physical activity and healthy eating habits, 
            such as the Healthy Active Learning initiative and Green Prescriptions.

            Physical activity not only improves physical health but also mental well-being, 
            as evidenced by a study on Chinese children. The study showed a positive 
            correlation between physical activity levels and mental well-being, self-efficacy, 
            and resilience.
