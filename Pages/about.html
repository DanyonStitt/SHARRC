        <p class="para">
            <b>Sport has the potential to positively affect the lives of nearly everyone.</b> 
            Whether through our own involvement or the sense of national pride when watching 
            our national athletes and teams compete, <b>we believe technological innovation 
            plays a crucial role.</b>

            SHARRC is a diverse team with expert knowledge in sports, health, and life 
            sciences, engineering, data science, psychology, business, and law, dedicated to using 
            innovative approaches to improve sports access, performance, equipment, and rehabilitation. 
            Our ultimate goal is to help people live healthier lives and achieve Sport NZ's vision of 
            "getting everbody active in Aotearoa New Zealand." Our team is passionate about promoting 
            healthy living and helping people prevent and overcome these health concerns. We believe 
            that everyone should have access to the best health care and support, regardless of

            Without diverse voices as part of the conversation, it is nearly impossible to 
            discover optimal solutions. The ability to imagine something new or come up with 
            a new solution wholly depends upon involving a variety of viewpoints.

        <h1>Challenges</h1>
        <p class="para">
            <b>New Zealand is facing some serious health challenges</b> caused by ageing populations, 
            sedentary lifestyles, and unhealthy habits like smoking, poor diet, or alcohol abuse. 
            These factors contribute to a high rates of heart disease, diabetes, obesity, 
            cancer, and mental health problems like depression and anxiety, costing over $100 million 
            per condition or risk factor every year!
        </p>
        <p class="para">
            Physical activity is essential to not only improve physical health 
            but also mental well-being, self-efficacy, and resilience. While the NZ Ministry of 
            Health has several initiatives in place to promote physical activity and healthy eating habits, 
            such as the Healthy Active Learning initiative and Green Prescriptions, Technological 
            innovation is a powerful tool to improve equality of access, enhance sports 
            performance, redesign equipment and apparel, reduce risk of injury, and improve 
            outcomes for rehabilitation.

            The proposed team has a significant diversity of experience, from sports 
            physiology, physiological modelling, well-being, human factors and behavioural 
            science, through to human interface technology and interactive game design. To 
            achieve the ambitious goals within this proposal, this diverse team is essential 
            to success. The project team also includes a diverse range of seniority, from 
            postdoctoral research fellows and lecturers, through to Professors
