        <h1>Why do we exist?</h1>
        <p class="para">
            <b>New Zealand is facing significant health challenges</b> due to ageing populations, 
            sedentary lifestyles, and unhealthy habits. These factors contribute to a 
            high rate of diseases, including heart disease, diabetes, obesity, cancer, 
            depression, and anxiety, <b>costing over $100 million per condition annually.</b>  
        </p>
        <p class="para">
            Physical activity is essential for improving physical and mental health, but 
            technological innovation is needed to improve equality of access, enhance 
            sports performance, reduce injury risks, and improve rehabilitation outcomes. 
            While the NZ Ministry of Health has several initiatives in place, SHARRC believes 
            that technology can play a crucial role in addressing these challenges.
        </p>
        <h1>Who we are</h1>
        <p class="para">
            SHARRC is a multidisciplinary team made up of experts in  
            sports physiology and health, data science, engineering, psychology, human 
            interface technology, interactive game design, and law. We use translational approaches 
            to improve sports access, performance, equipment, and rehabilitation outcomes, with the 
            goal of helping people live healthier lives. The team is diverse in experience and seniority, 
            ranging from PhD and postdoctoral research fellows to professors and industry leaders. Their 
            ultimate goal is to achieve Sport NZ's vision of getting everyone active in New Zealand and 
            ensuring access to quality healthcare regardless of background.

            Without diverse voices as part of the conversation, it is nearly impossible to 
            discover optimal solutions. The ability to imagine something new or come up with 
            a new solution entirely depends upon involving a variety of viewpoints.
