            Sport has the potential to positively affect the lives of nearly every New 
            Zealander, whether it be through the sense of national pride that arises through 
            watching our national athletes and teams compete or through our own involvement 
            in health via sports and physical activity.

            SHARRC is a multi- and inter-disciplinary research cluster, which combines domains 
            of sports, health sciences, engineering, design, data science, life sciences, 
            human-computer interaction, social and psychological sciences, business, and law.

            Without diverse voices as part of the conversation, it is nearly impossible to 
            discover optimal solutions. According to CERIC in Canada, diversity leads to innovation [17]. 
            The ability to imagine something new or come up with a new solution wholly depends upon a 
            variety of viewpoints involved in the brainstorming, design, testing, manufacture, and feedback.

        <div class="para">
            We believe technological innovation plays a crucial role 
            in improving sports access, performance, equipment, and rehabilitation outcomes. 
            We are committed to using innovative approaches to improve health outcomes and 
            assist with Sport NZ's vision of "getting Every Body Active in Aotearoa New 
            Zealand."

            New Zealand is facing some serious health challenges caused by ageing populations, 
            sedentary lifestyles, and unhealthy habits like smoking, poor diet, and alcohol 
            and drug abuse. These factors can lead to a variety of health issues, including 
            heart disease, diabetes, obesity, cancer, and mental health problems like 
            depression and anxiety.
        </div>

        <div class="para">
            The cost of these health issues is staggering - over $100 million per condition 
            or risk factor every year! Our team is passionate about promoting healthy living 
            and helping people prevent and overcome these health concerns. We believe that 
            everyone should have access to the best health care and support, regardless of 
            their background.
        </div>

        <div class="para">
            To prevent and rehabilitate from these health conditions, promoting physical 
            activity is essential. Fortunately, the NZ Ministry of Health has several 
            initiatives in place to promote physical activity and healthy eating habits, 
            such as the Healthy Active Learning initiative and Green Prescriptions.

            Physical activity not only improves physical health but also mental well-being, 
            as evidenced by a study on Chinese children. The study showed a positive 
            correlation between physical activity levels and mental well-being, self-efficacy, 
            and resilience.
